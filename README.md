## AAS191A-RacialEquity

# What social problem is being addressed:
This project will address the disparity in educational opportunities and outcomes in different Asian American communities, highlighting the different outcomes for East, South, and Southeast Asian communities. This project seeks to uplift the experiences of and challenges faced by the various Asian American ethnic groups, challenging the aggregation and conglomeration of all these diverse communities as an Asian American monolith.

# What problems you think may arise in developing this application (both technical and ethical). 
From a technical standpoint, there may definitely be challenges in finding data that disaggregates Asian American communities into smaller ethnic groups, given the nature of data collection of different racial/ethnic groups.
